# React Stripe Storyboard

## A frontend stateful UI for Stripe account connection using React

#### Thanks for checking out my work! Please feel free to take a look at this video I recorded that explains my process in a little bit of detail: https://www.loom.com/share/ba60b322ba004759bc411f6b97534197

### Here are answers to the questions that were asked:

1. Have you ever worked on big projects?

  - I have developed and deployed complete websites from the ground up many times. Although I haven't worked with a team to build large scale projects, I am very interested to grow my skills and provide value in a team setting.

2. How many years of experience do you have working with React.js?

  - I have been working with React for less than a year, as I have been growing my foundational knowledge of vanilla Javascript. Needless to say, doing so has allowed me to step into React projects quite easily once I learned the basics of what is 'under the hood' of the library.
  
3. Do you have solid experience working with the class components?
  
  - I have refactored projects from class-based components to functional components, and back again. This process has grown my skills immensely, and I am ready to continue to grow my skills in every regard needed.
